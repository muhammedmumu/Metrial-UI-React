## ✅ All Issues Resolved Successfully!

### 🚨 **Issues Found and Fixed:**

#### **1. Parsing Error in dashboard.config.js**
**Problem:** 
```javascript
x th// Configuration file for easy customization
```
**Issue:** Corrupted text "x th" at the beginning of the file causing a parsing error.

**Fix:** ✅ Removed corrupted characters
```javascript
// Configuration file for easy customization
```

#### **2. Incorrect Import Path in theme.js**
**Problem:** 
```javascript
import { dashboardConfig } from '../config/dashboard.config.js';
```
**Issue:** Wrong relative path after moving theme.js to `assets/styles/` folder.

**Fix:** ✅ Updated to correct path
```javascript
import { dashboardConfig } from '../../config/dashboard.config.js';
```

#### **3. Missing Axios Dependency**
**Problem:** 
```
Could not resolve import "axios" from "src/api/client.js"
```
**Issue:** Axios was imported in API client but not installed as a dependency.

**Fix:** ✅ Installed axios
```bash
npm install axios
```

### 🎯 **Verification Results:**

- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Manual chunking configuration
- Lazy loading for routes
